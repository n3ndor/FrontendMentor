## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned a way how to set the font size differently in TailwindCSS:

text-[1.2rem]


### Continued development

This was a basic example, hopefully I made it how it should be. But later I will review again.
